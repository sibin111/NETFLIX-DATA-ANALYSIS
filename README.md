## Overview

The **Netflix Story** project is a data analysis and visualization project that focuses on examining and presenting insights from Netflix-related data. The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle.com and provides valuable information about Netflix content.

The primary goal of this project is to leverage Tableau to explore, analyze, and visualize the dataset. By doing so, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and interesting insights related to Netflix's content library, viewership, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be obtained from Kaggle.com. It contains comprehensive information about Netflix titles, including details like title, type (movie or TV show), release year, country, duration, and more. The dataset is crucial for conducting in-depth analyses and creating informative visualizations.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning

Before diving into data visualization, we'll perform data exploration and cleaning. This step involves:

- Handling missing or inconsistent data.
- Exploring the dataset's structure.
- Identifying any outliers or anomalies.

### 2. Tableau Visualization

The core of this project lies in using Tableau to create compelling visualizations. We'll design interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs to showcase key findings. Possible areas of exploration include:

- Trends in Netflix content over the years.
- Distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows).
- Popular genres.
- Geographic distribution of content.
- Viewer ratings and reviews.

### 3. Documentation

A well-documented project is essential for sharing insights and findings. We'll prepare documentation that includes:

- A brief project overview.
- Details of the dataset used.
- Explanation of Tableau visualizations and their significance.
- Insights and observations from the analysis.
